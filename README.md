## Introduction

Welcome to **Nyxa Bot**, the living, breathing narrator and core entity of **Project X** â€“ an ambitious, art-directed Discord RPG platform. Born from the shattered remnants of a simpler dream, Project X has evolved into a meticulously crafted ecosystem where every mechanic is woven into a grand, cosmic narrative. Guided by Nyxa, players embark on an epic journey of class selection, companion collection, and unfolding mysteries.

This project is a testament to the power of structured design and iterative development, transforming a humble bot concept into a scalable, lore-rich RPG experience.
