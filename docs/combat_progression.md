# Nyxa Combat & Progression System Design

## Team Structure
- 3-Esprit parties: 1 Main Fighter + 2 Support
- Main Esprit: Active in combat, visible in UI
- Support Esprits: Provide secondary skills to main fighter
- Class system: Guardian, Destroyer, Mystic, Support
- Class synergies: Team bonuses for specific combinations

## Skill System
- Each Esprit: 2 active abilities (Main + Secondary)
- Main Skill: High MP cost, long cooldown, signature ability
- Secondary Skill: Lower cost, short cooldown, utility focused
- Combat options: Main fighter uses own skills + supports' secondary skills
- 5 total abilities available per combat encounter

## Combat Flow
- Turn-based: Player vs Boss only (no party turn management)
- Discord dropdown: Select from available skills
- Fast resolution: 2-4 turn battles maximum
- Visual feedback: Damage numbers, effects, status updates
- Mobile-friendly: Simple button interactions

## Progression Commands

### /explore (5-minute cooldown)
- Random monster encounters
- Rewards: 5-15 azurite_shards, 10-50 nyxies, materials
- Primary fragment income source
- Quick, repeatable content loop

### /tower [level] [floor] (1-100 floors)
- Structured boss progression
- Prerequisites: Must clear previous floor
- Milestone rewards: Major fragment bonuses at key floors

## Economy & Progression

### Fragment System
- Single currency for summons: 100 azurite_shards = 1 pull

- No energy/stamina gates: Just time-based cooldowns
- Nyxies: Instant summons, premium purchases

### Milestone Rewards
- Sigil Power milestones: 1K, 5K, 10K, 25K thresholds
- Rewards: Azurite Shards + nyxies + mystery chests

## Interconnected Systems

- Everything feeds back into collection and progression
- No dead-end currencies or isolated mechanics
- Clear upgrade path: Collect → Upgrade → Progress → Repeat
