## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-07

This release represents a complete redesign of the core summoning experience and a major refactor of the underlying architecture to improve stability, performance, and data integrity.

### Added
- **Class System**: Introduced a `class_name` field to the `EspritData` model to categorize Esprits (e.g., Guardian, Destroyer).
- **Dynamic "Rarity Aura"**: The summon card background now features a pronounced, soft aura of light, with the color dynamically set by the Esprit's rarity tier.
- **Graphical Rarity Icons**: The card now renders a custom graphical icon for each rarity tier, replacing text-based rarity display on the image.
- **Class Emojis**: The Discord embed for the summon result now displays the Esprit's class, prefixed with a thematic emoji for at-a-glance role identification.

### Changed
- **Summon Card Redesign**: The card generated by `image_generator.py` is now minimalist and art-focused, containing only the Esprit's name as a header and a rarity icon.
- **Summon Embed Redesign**: All detailed information (Class, Rarity Name) has been moved to the Discord embed's description field for a cleaner presentation.
- **Summon Command Logic**: The `/summon` command has been restricted to only allow amounts of **1** or **10** to strengthen the game's economic loop.
- **Atomic Transactions**: All database commands (`/start`, `/summon`, `/daily`, etc.) were refactored to use a single, atomic transaction per command.
- **Asynchronous Image Generation**: Blocking image generation tasks were moved to a background thread (`run_in_executor`) to keep the bot responsive.
- **Singleton `ConfigManager`**: The `ConfigManager` is now a shared instance created at bot startup to improve efficiency.

### Fixed
- **Interaction Timeouts**: Resolved `404 Unknown Interaction` errors by implementing `interaction.response.defer()` for all long-running commands.
- **Image Generation Stability**: Corrected multiple `TypeError` and `ValueError` bugs related to caching, image compositing, and silhouette generation.
- **Data Integrity**: Fixed data mismatches between JSON configuration files and database models, particularly for the `class_name` field.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-06

### Changed
- **Centralized Game Settings**: Refactored all cogs to pull economic values (e.g., starting gold, daily rewards, summon costs) from a single configuration file at `data/config/game_settings.json`.
- **Removed Hardcoded Values**: Eliminated "magic numbers" for economic parameters from the Python codebase, separating configuration from logic and improving maintainability.
