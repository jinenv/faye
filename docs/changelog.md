## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-09

This release marks a fundamental architectural overhaul, establishing a persistent, version-controlled database and a completely redesigned economy, setting the stage for all future content.

### Added
- **Database Migration System**: Implemented `Alembic` to manage all database schema changes and static data seeding, ensuring a robust, production-ready workflow.
- **New Currencies**: Introduced **Essence** (crafting material) and **Loot Chests** to the database model.
- **Complete Admin Command Suite**: Built a full suite of owner-only commands under `/admin`, including:
    - `/admin give` for all currencies (Nyxies, Moonglow, Azurite Shards, Essence) and XP.
    - `/admin give esprit` to grant specific Esprits to users.
    - `/admin reset` for user data and daily cooldowns.
    - `/admin set` for player and Esprit levels.
    - `/admin remove` to safely delete Esprit instances.
    - `/admin inspect` and `/admin help` for utility.
- **Cog Reloading**: Added an `/admin reload` command to allow for hot-reloading of cogs during development, significantly speeding up the iteration cycle.

### Changed
- **Economy System Refactor**: The entire in-game economy has been restructured to align with the project directive.
    - `gold` has been renamed to **Nyxies** (universal soft currency).
    - `dust` has been renamed to **Moonglow** (Esprit enhancement currency).
    - `fragments` has been renamed to **Azurite Shards**, which form **Azurites** (the sole summoning currency).
- **Backend Stability**: Refactored all database models to resolve `InvalidRequestError` by explicitly defining foreign key relationships, stabilizing all commands.
- **Cog Logic**: Updated `economy_cog`, `summon_cog`, `onboarding_cog`, and `admin_cog` to use the new currency names and database structure.

### Fixed
- **Daily Command Logic**: Corrected a bug where `/reset daily` did not properly reset the cooldown for the `/daily` command by reverting to a database-driven timestamp check.
- **Database Integrity**: Resolved all `AttributeError` and `InvalidRequestError` issues stemming from the database refactor.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-07

This release represents a complete redesign of the core summoning experience and a major refactor of the underlying architecture to improve stability, performance, and data integrity.

### Added
- **Class System**: Introduced a `class_name` field to the `EspritData` model to categorize Esprits (e.g., Guardian, Destroyer).
- **Dynamic "Rarity Aura"**: The summon card background now features a pronounced, soft aura of light, with the color dynamically set by the Esprit's rarity tier.
- **Graphical Rarity Icons**: The card now renders a custom graphical icon for each rarity tier, replacing text-based rarity display on the image.
- **Class Emojis**: The Discord embed for the summon result now displays the Esprit's class, prefixed with a thematic emoji for at-a-glance role identification.

### Changed
- **Summon Card Redesign**: The card generated by `image_generator.py` is now minimalist and art-focused, containing only the Esprit's name as a header and a rarity icon.
- **Summon Embed Redesign**: All detailed information (Class, Rarity Name) has been moved to the Discord embed's description field for a cleaner presentation.
- **Summon Command Logic**: The `/summon` command has been restricted to only allow amounts of **1** or **10** to strengthen the game's economic loop.
- **Atomic Transactions**: All database commands (`/start`, `/summon`, `/daily`, etc.) were refactored to use a single, atomic transaction per command.
- **Asynchronous Image Generation**: Blocking image generation tasks were moved to a background thread (`run_in_executor`) to keep the bot responsive.
- **Singleton `ConfigManager`**: The `ConfigManager` is now a shared instance created at bot startup to improve efficiency.

### Fixed
- **Interaction Timeouts**: Resolved `404 Unknown Interaction` errors by implementing `interaction.response.defer()` for all long-running commands.
- **Image Generation Stability**: Corrected multiple `TypeError` and `ValueError` bugs related to caching, image compositing, and silhouette generation.
- **Data Integrity**: Fixed data mismatches between JSON configuration files and database models, particularly for the `class_name` field.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-06

### Changed
- **Centralized Game Settings**: Refactored all cogs to pull economic values (e.g., starting Nyxies, daily rewards, summon costs) from a single configuration file at `data/config/game_settings.json`.
- **Removed Hardcoded Values**: Eliminated "magic numbers" for economic parameters from the Python codebase, separating configuration from logic and improving maintainability.
