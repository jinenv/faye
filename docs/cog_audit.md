# Faye System Architecture & Cog Compliance Audit

**Date:** 2025-06-14  
**Author:** Jin & Assistant  
**Project:** Faye â€“ A Discord-based RPG System  
**Objective:** Finalize system-wide cog audit for performance, stability, and gameplay integrity.

---

## âœ… Summary of What Was Done

### 1. Full Lifecycle Compliance Across Cogs
- Every slash command starts with `await interaction.response.defer()`
- All responses use `interaction.followup.send()`
- Interaction lifecycle is fully completed, even on failure

### 2. Error Handling Standardization
- All command logic is wrapped in `try/except`
- Internal issues are logged with full tracebacks via `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`
- User-facing errors are short, clear, and formatted with emojis for visual feedback

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Rate limiter integrated in each cog: 5 calls per 60 seconds (adjustable)
- Users exceeding limits get cooldowns shown with timers

### 4. Database Integrity & Session Handling
- All DB calls use `async with get_session()` to ensure safe access
- `selectinload()` used to prevent lazy loading
- Mutations use `with_for_update` for row locking

### 5. Redis-Ready Utilities
- All caching (e.g. `CacheManager`) abstracted with fallback if Redis isn't active
- No cog or feature depends strictly on Redis

### 6. Visibility Rules (Ephemeral)
- All interactive commands default to **public**
    - Summons, inventory, upgrades, dailies, teams are **public**
    - Admin or sensitive commands remain **ephemeral**
- Ephemeral behavior can be toggled internally if needed

### 7. Structured Logging via `transaction_logger`
Each transaction-type command logs:
- Action type (summon, upgrade, dissolve, etc.)
- User and esprit involved
- Resources spent/earned
- Resulting state (power levels, levels, etc.)

### 8. Enhanced UI & Embedded Feedback
- Views like `EnhancedCollectionView`, `ConfirmationView`, `BulkDissolveView` built
- Clear emoji-coded rarity tiers and status displays
- All views check user ID for safety

### 9. Flavor & Personality Enhancements
- Summons and actions include randomized flavor text lines
- Embed titles and colors are thematic per action
- Descriptions are lore-friendly without bloating

## âœ… Completed Cogs and Modules

| Cog / File               | Status    | Notes |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------|
| `onboarding_cog.py`      | âœ… Clean   | With `/start`, `/daily`, and welcome logic |
| `esprit_cog.py`          | âœ… Clean   | Core systems: collection, upgrades, LB, dissolve |
| `summon_cog.py`          | âœ… Clean   | Full summon logic, UI views, flavor |
| `utility_cog.py`         | âœ… Clean   | RateLimiter, logger, config, cache, UID gen |
| `admin_cog.py`           | âœ… Clean   | UID assignment, resets, inspection commands |
| `cache_manager.py`       | âœ… Redis-ready | Works with/without Redis backend |
| `transaction_logger.py`  | âœ… Hooked | Logs every meaningful user action |
| `views` (confirmation)   | âœ… Used   | Used in critical actions for user confirmation |
| `views` (collection/bulk)| âœ… Used   | Used for collection and dissolve management |

## âœ… Final Review Prompt for Gemini

```md
You are a senior backend engineer auditing a real-time RPG Discord bot built using `discord.py 2.3.2`, `SQLModel`, and an eventual Redis backend.

Please review the following:
1. All slash commands in each cog follow full interaction lifecycle (`defer`, `followup`, error resolution)
2. Rate limiting is applied globally (5 calls per 60s)
3. All DB usage is safe: `async with get_session()`, `selectinload`, `with_for_update` used where applicable
4. Redis-safe cache manager is injected but does not break if Redis is down
5. Public vs. ephemeral usage is logical: combat, summon, inventory, teams are visible
6. All commands log meaningful user actions via a structured logger
7. Views use proper interaction checks, timeouts, and user-safe interaction guards
8. Responses use styled embeds, emojis, and flavor text to enhance UX

Please validate the architectural soundness, UX consistency, and resilience under scale before we proceed to audit `combat_cog.py`.

List any red flags, regressions, or unsafe practices you detect. You may request specific files or contexts if needed.

This system was renamed from "Nyxa" to "Faye" and all identifiers reflect that.

Thank you.
